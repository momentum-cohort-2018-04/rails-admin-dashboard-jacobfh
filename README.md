# Adding an Admin Dashboard

Your homework submission should be a README explaining what you decided to do, including a link to the project repo that you added the admin dashboard to. Please also include a screenshot of the admin dashboard main page to illustrate your README.

I added admin dashboard to my record collection app. This allows the admin to perform crud actions on any of the albumbs. I don't have users yet, but I can see where this would be very useful in managing users and posts.
